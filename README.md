2x2 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Simulation with BPSK and Zero-Forcing Equalization

    Spatial Multiplexing MATLAB code contains simulation of 2x2 MIMO system with spatial multiplexing. 
    The channel uses  Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) as the modulation scheme in the simulation and 
    the channel is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel model with Rayleigh fading. The BER with 
    various SNRs is used to evaluate this system's performance.
